##Testing OpenAI and LangChain

Welcome to the Testing OpenAI and LangChain repository! This project serves as a sandbox for exploring, learning, and experimenting with the capabilities of OpenAI’s models and LangChain. Here, you’ll find various scripts, notebooks, and code snippets demonstrating how to leverage these tools effectively.

Overview

The purpose of this repository is to:

	•	Explore OpenAI’s APIs: Experiment with various functionalities, from simple prompts to more complex tasks like summarization, translation, and question-answering.
	•	Learn LangChain: Test LangChain’s features for building chatbots, handling memory, chaining multiple models together, and other advanced use cases.
	•	Document Learning Process: Share insights, observations, and examples for those who are also curious about integrating these technologies into their projects.

Contents

	1.	/notebooks: Interactive Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step examples and explanations.
	2.	/scripts: Python scripts for running LangChain pipelines and OpenAI API experiments.
	3.	/examples: Code samples showcasing practical use cases.
	4.	/resources: Additional resources, links, and documentation references.

Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have:

	•	Python 3.8 or later
	•	An OpenAI API key
	•	Required libraries installed (use requirements.txt)
